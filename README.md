About This Project

This website was built as part of my professional development journey, combining **HTML** and **CSS** to design and structure a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface.

Through many focused hours, I was able to sharpen my technical skills, improve my understanding of DOM **structure, semantic HTML**, and **responsive design**, while also practicing a QA-oriented mindset that emphasizes:

**Test Coverage**- verifying functionality across browsers and screen sizes

**Usability Testing**- ensuring intuitive navigation and accessibility

**Cross-Platform Validation**- simulating user experience on both desktop and mobile

**Regression Mindset**- checking that new adjustments do not break existing components

This project is more than just a personal portfolio, it is also a **QA practice field** where I applied critical concepts such as **exploratory testing**, **test scenarios,** and **defect detection** in a real environment.
